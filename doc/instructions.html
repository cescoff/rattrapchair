    <H1>Laser Cut</H1>
    <H2>Before launching you laser cut</H2>
    <p>Here is a list of tools you need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8mm span plywood (enough to do your chairs). The span MUST be 8mm</li>
        <li>A pencil</li>
        <li>A box that you can maintain easily closed (for some tiny parts)</li>
        <li>Tiny elastics to keep some parts together and not lose them (if you are making more than 1 chair)</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Dealing with the files</H2>
    <p>The files are in SVG format. This is an open source format supported by most of the vector drawing softwares. All you have to do is right click on the file and choose "Open with" and then open the file within your favorite installed software</p>
    <H2>How to handle the wood once cut</H2>
    <p>Note: all layers are cut with the top face of the chair on the top of the laser cut plan. The layers are not really oriented but at least it is recommended to keep this orientation</p>

    <H3>Layer A</H3>
    <p>The image below shows you what pieces of wood are wasted on this layer. All striped areas in red are the one that you actually can drop</p>

    <img src="https://github.com/cescoff/rattrapchair/blob/master/doc/img/Layer_A_2.png?raw=true"/>
    <p>Once all wasted wood parts are removed you can flip the parts and write the layer name on the back of them. Parts from different layers look the same and should not be swapped at mount time.</p>
    <p>If you are printing a chair in split mode, please note to which part of the split the parts are belonging. Same as the different layers the parts from the same split look exactly the same be are not</p>
    <p>Here is a naming convention : A_<SPLIT_NUMBER> where SPLIT_NUMBER has value 0 or 1.</p>
    <p>This layer is quite simple, the worst is layer B ;)</p>
    <H3>Layer B</H3>
    <p>For this layer you will need both the box and the elastics ;)</p>
    <p>The image below shows you what pieces of wood are wasted on this layer. All striped areas in red are the one that you actually can drop</p>
    <p><red><b>Beware of the seat axle part, you must choose the right one, because if you don't choose the right one, you will not be able to put the rear axle.</b></red></p>

    <img src="https://github.com/cescoff/rattrapchair/blob/master/doc/img/Layer_B_2.png?raw=true"/>
    <p>Once all wasted wood parts are removed you directly write (no need to flip) on the different parts of the layer. Keep in mind the naming convention of layer A</p>
    <p>Put all the tiny parts of the hinge into the box and keep them secure (try not to loose them)</p>
    <H3>Layer C</H3>
    <p>The image below shows you what pieces of wood are wasted on this layer. All striped areas in red are the one that you actually can drop</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/cescoff/rattrapchair/blob/master/doc/img/Layer_C_1.png?raw=true"/>

    <H1>Mounting your chair</H1>
    <H2>Before starting to mount it</H2>
    <p>Here is a list of tools you need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>300 ml of white wood glue (vinyl)</li>
        <li>40 little F Clamps</li>
        <li>A set of wood pegs (8mm diameter)</li>
        <li>About 35 clothespins (strong if possible) or clamp clips</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>First parts to glue</H2>
    <H3>Hinge heads</H3>
    <p>You need to glue the tiny hinge crenel heads to the layer C. The hinge heads are parts of the B layer.</p>
    <p>You need to glue them on both leg and seat and fasten them using the spins</p>
    <p>The image below shows you what your chair in progress should look like</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/cescoff/rattrapchair/blob/master/doc/img/TeethGlueSample.jpeg?raw=true">
    <p>Wait at least 2 hours for a quick-setting glue</p>
    <H3>Slider axle</H3>
    <p>At the rear of the seat you have to glue the slider axle (provided by layer B) on the C part of the seat</p>
    <p>Wait at least 2 hours for a quick-setting glue</p>
    <H2>Chair frame</H2>
    <p>The chair frame can be mounted in one pass even if you chose to cut a splited version of your chair</p>
    <p>Advice: The peg holes are really adjusted to make the mounting operation easily. But I really advice to you to put them on layer A parts from the external to the internal face. Internal face is the one on which the part layer are written.</p>
    <p><red><b>On layer A do not put glue on the bottom middle area of the frame. The area will not be fastened to another one</b></red></p>
    <p>Put all your F Clamps on the frame as shown on the following image</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/cescoff/rattrapchair/blob/master/doc/img/FStampsSample.jpeg?raw=true">
    <H2>Chair leg</H2>
    <p>You have to put glue on layer A (on the face on which you wrote)</p>
    <p><red><b>Note: on the leg you have another slider for the leg axle. Do not put glue on it. Prefer making a dry run of the mount before putting glue (mark the glued areas). This slider is used to fold the chair. The slider length is about 10 cm, you have to put the C layer leg bottom in the right position. A detractor hole is there to help you by putting a peg into it you will have no mounting issue</b></red></p>
    <p>Once you did not mistake you can glue the full leg</p>
    <red><b>Do not forget to put glue on the hinge teeth and fasten them using clamps clips</b></red>
    <H2>Chair seat</H2>
    <p>This part is quite simple to mount</p>
    <red><b>Do not forget to put glue on the hinge teeth and fasten them using clamps clips</b></red>
    <red><b>Do not forget to put glue on the seat rear slide axle and fasten them using clamps clips</b></red>
    <H2>Building the axles</H2>
    <p>Here is a list of stuff you need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1m long strong 8mm threaded shafts</li>
        <li>4 8mm nuts</li>
        <li>A bottle of thread locker</li>
        <li>A pair of 13mm wide wrench</li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Seat slider</H3>
    <p>Cut a piece of threaded shaft at ${fullTopSliderAxleWidth}mm</p>
    <H3>Seat hinge</H3>
    <p>Cut a piece of threaded shaft at ${fullSeatHingeAxleWidth}mm</p>
    <H3>Seat leg axle</H3>
    <p>Cut a piece of threaded shaft at ${fullLegAxleWidth}mm</p>
